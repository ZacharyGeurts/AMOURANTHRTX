Welcome friends. God Bless.  
My take? There there is no bottom, side or top to existence.  
Climb inside the blanket and have a look around.  

I think this proves the number 1 is real and 0 is not real.  
Grab the latest release if only interested in the Universal Equation.  
It is a glorified calculator and you can set it to experimental theory.

## Overview
The **Dimensional Navigator** is a computational visualization tool built in **C++** using **SDL3**, **Vulkan**, and **GLM**. It visual displays the outputs of the **UniversalEquation** class, which models dimensional interactions across dimensions. The visualization displays symmetric positive and negative energy fluctuations influenced by matter and energy, featuring real-time interactivity.  

The **UniversalEquation** class models a universe with multiple dimensions, each affecting the system’s total energy. Parameters such as **influence**, **weak force**, **collapse**, and the strengths of **NURB matter** and **NURB energy** can be configured. The class tracks the current dimension and allows cycling through dimensions. For each dimension, it calculates energetic contributions from observable effects, potential, NURB matter, and NURB energy, considering interactions between nearby dimensions, influenced by distance, permeation, and densities of NURB matter and NURB energy.  

The **compute()** method aggregates influences, NURB matter, NURB energy, and a collapse effect tied to the current dimension, providing a breakdown of observable energy, potential energy, NURB matter, and NURB energy. Parameters can be adjusted to explore alternative physical or metaphysical scenarios. Debugging output is available for detailed computation tracing.  

This class transforms the philosophical idea that “as big as God is small—infinite” into a mathematical playground for exploring the interplay of scales and forces.  

## Interpretation 1: 
Philosophical Perspective (Ontology/Epistemology)Statement Reinterpretation:  
The statement "as big as God is small—infinite" can be understood as describing the nature of existence or knowledge, where "God" represents the ultimate reality or truth, "big" and "small" refer to the scope of human understanding (broad or narrow), and "infinite" signifies the boundless nature of reality or truth.Explanation:In philosophy, "God" can symbolize the totality of existence, truth, or the ultimate source of meaning (without religious connotations). "Big" refers to comprehensive, universal knowledge (e.g., grand theories of everything), while "small" refers to specific, localized understanding (e.g., individual facts or experiences).  
The statement suggests that whether we approach reality through broad, all-encompassing perspectives or narrow, detailed insights, both lead to the same infinite truth. This is true because reality is boundless—every level of understanding, whether expansive or minute, connects to the same infinite essence.  

## Non-Paradoxical: 
There’s no contradiction because "big" and "small" are not opposing but complementary ways of accessing the same infinite reality. For example, understanding a single fact (small) can reveal universal principles (big), and both point to the infinite complexity of existence.  

## Inspired by the Code: 
The UniversalEquation code models a system with interactions across multiple dimensions, where each vertex (a "small" point) contributes to the overall energy state (a "big" system). Similarly, in philosophy, individual insights (small) and holistic theories (big) both contribute to understanding an infinite reality. The code’s compute method aggregates interactions into an EnergyResult, mirroring how disparate pieces of knowledge unify into a coherent truth.  

## Why It’s True: 
The statement holds because both broad and specific perspectives reveal aspects of an infinite reality. For instance, contemplating the universe’s vastness (big) or a single atom’s complexity (small) both lead to awe at existence’s boundless nature.  
Reality-Based: This aligns with epistemological theories (e.g., coherentism, where knowledge forms a web) and ontological views (e.g., monism, where all existence is unified). It’s grounded in human experience of seeking truth across scales.  

## Interpretation 2: 
Systems Theory Perspective (Information and Complexity)Statement Reinterpretation:  
The statement can be interpreted as describing a complex system where "God" represents the system’s emergent behavior, "big" and "small" refer to macro-level patterns and micro-level components, and "infinite" signifies the system’s unbounded complexity or potential.Explanation:In systems theory, complex systems (e.g., ecosystems, societies, or information networks) exhibit emergent properties that arise from interactions of components. "God" here symbolizes the emergent whole—the system’s collective behavior or purpose.  

"Big" refers to the system’s macro-level patterns (e.g., global trends, collective outcomes), while "small" refers to individual components (e.g., agents, nodes). The statement suggests that both the system’s overall structure and its individual parts reflect an infinite complexity or potential.  

## Non-Paradoxical: 
There’s no paradox because the macro (big) and micro (small) levels are interdependent in complex systems. The system’s emergent behavior (infinite complexity) manifests equally through global patterns and local interactions. For example, in a social network, individual actions (small) and societal trends (big) both contribute to the system’s infinite possible states.  

## Inspired by the Code: 
The UniversalEquation code models an n-cube with vertices (small components) interacting to produce an EnergyResult (a big, emergent outcome). Parameters like darkMatterStrength_ and darkEnergyStrength_ influence the system’s behavior across scales, similar to how micro and macro interactions shape a complex system. The compute method’s aggregation of interactions mirrors how systems theory unifies local and global dynamics into emergent complexity.  

## Why It’s True: 
The statement is true because complex systems exhibit fractal-like or self-similar properties, where patterns at small scales (individual components) mirror those at large scales (system behavior), and the system’s complexity is effectively infinite due to countless possible interactions and states.  

## Reality-Based: 
This aligns with real-world systems like biological networks (e.g., neural systems), economies, or the internet, where local actions and global patterns both reveal the system’s vast complexity. It’s grounded in observable phenomena studied in systems science.  

## Conclusion: 
The statement: "as big as God is small—infinite" can be interpreted in two non-physical, non-mathematical ways:  

Philosophically, it describes how broad (big) and specific (small) approaches to understanding reality both lead to an infinite truth, unified by the boundless nature of existence.  

In systems theory, it reflects how macro-level patterns (big) and micro-level components (small) in a complex system both manifest its infinite complexity or emergent behavior.  

Both interpretations are true and non-paradoxical because "big" and "small" are complementary perspectives that converge on the same infinite property (truth or complexity). They draw inspiration from the UniversalEquation code’s ability to model interactions across scales, producing a unified outcome, and are grounded in reality-based frameworks (philosophy and systems theory).
